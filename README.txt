HW 4

Issues I Had:

1) Was not really sure what is Comparator less_than.
SOLVED: Discussion board had answers by Owen that kinda clarified it.

2) Not sure where to "clock" the Algorithms
SOLVED: tried to do so inside the algorithm (in Sort.h), that didn't make much sense,
        so I moved it to the .cp file.

3) Damn thing won't work
SOLVED: Capitalization syntax issue. Moving on...

4) Quicksort when "greater" doesn't Verify (Verified: 0)
SOLVED: Had to edit insertionSort, now all Verifies

5) Add the pivots to quickSort. not sure how
SOLVED: experimented until success!

6) Submitted to GS, 27.0/37.0 pts. ComputeDuration, Generate random/sorted and ComputeDuration are ["Errno 2"]
SOLVED:
